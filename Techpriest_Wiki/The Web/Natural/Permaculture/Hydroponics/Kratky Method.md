**Hydroponics** may provide the answer, and **Kratky Method Hydroponics** is the simplest way to start. 

## Hydroponics is the practice of growing plants without soil, in nutrient rich water.   

Hydroponics have been around since the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which was built around 600 B.C.  Modern hydroponics made significant advancements about 100 years ago at UC Berkeley when Dr. William Gericke grew 25 ft tall tomato plants without soil.  One of the people who studied Dr. Gericke's work was Bernard Kratky who went on to receive his Masters and Ph. D. in Horticulture from Purdue University.  

The key concept about the Kratky Method is it is one of the few **passive** hydroponic methods.  This means no electricity is used to pump air or water.  This graphic shows the separation between passive and active hydroponics.

## Air roots

Notice the fine, white roots just below the cup.  These are "air roots" and they develop in the moist air space above the nutrient water.  This is a special adaptation that plants make to absorb oxygen from the air while the water roots below the air roots absorb the nutrient water.   You may know that plants absorb carbon dioxide?  They do that through the leaves while oxygen is absorbed through the roots.  The discovery of this adaptability of plants was revolutionary and critical for the success of this method since air pumps are not used.   These air roots are fragile and should never be submersed. Even splashing them with water can stress the plant.  They can also be damaged if not kept in a moist environment.

## Summary

-   People have been growing without soil in nutrient rich water for thousands of years
-   Hydroponic growing methods are  separated into **passive** (without pumps) and **active** (with pumps)  methods.
-   Dr. Bernard Kratky is one of the scientists who helped develop the most popular method of **passive** hydroponics which now bears his name.
-   Success with the Kratky Method depends on understanding the concept of **air roots** which develop in the moist air space above the nutrient water.
-   Air roots must not be submerged or splashed with water.
