Dorothy Day (1897-1980) was an American Catholic social activist, journalist, and founder of the [Catholic Worker](Catholic%20Worker.md) Movement. She is best known for her nonviolent actions, work with the poor and homeless, work for the rights of workers, and particularly the publication of The Catholic Worker newspaper and the establishment of Houses of Hospitality, which provided food, shelter, and community to those in need.  
  
Day's life was marked by a commitment to social justice, nonviolence, and service to others. She believed that Christians had a responsibility to live out their faith by serving the poor and marginalized. Her work often brought her into conflict with the institutional aspects of the Catholic Church, but she remained steadfast in her Catholic Faith.  
  
Day co-founded the Catholic Worker movement with [Peter Maurin](Peter%20Maurin.md).
