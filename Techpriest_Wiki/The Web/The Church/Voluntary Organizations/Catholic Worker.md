The Catholic Worker Movement is a global network of intentional communities and individuals inspired by the vision of [Dorothy Day](Dorothy%20Day.md) and [Peter Maurin](Peter%20Maurin.md). It's a grassroots movement that seeks to live out the Gospel message by serving the poor, promoting social justice, and building alternative forms of community.  
  
The movement was founded in 1933 with the publication of The Catholic Worker newspaper, which became a platform for Day and Maurin to share their ideas on poverty, nonviolence, and community living. The paper's mission was to provide news, commentary, and inspiration to those working towards social change.  
  
Over time, the movement grew to include various forms of activism, such as:  
  
1. Houses of Hospitality: Providing food, shelter, and care for the poor and homeless.  
2. Anti-war and anti-nuclear efforts: Promoting nonviolence and peaceful conflict resolution.  
3. Ecological initiatives: Focusing on environmental sustainability and conservation.  
  
The Catholic Worker Movement is characterized by its commitment to:  
  
1. Nonviolent direct action  
2. Community living among the poor  
3. Simple, self-sufficient lifestyles  
4. Advocacy for social justice and human rights
